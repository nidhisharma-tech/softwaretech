      content: `Full-stack development involves building both the client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend) parts of a web application. A full-stack developer is proficient in all layers of development, from the user interface (UI) to the databases and server logic. This is different from a frontend developer, who focuses on the UI, and a backend developer, who handles the server and database components.`
